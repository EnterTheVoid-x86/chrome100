# chrome100

A directory of recovery images for Google's operating system, Chrome OS.

Documentation is a work in progress. See the website live at https://chrome100.dev/.

See the wiki [here](https://github.com/sysce/chrome100/wiki).

The legacy branch contains an earlier path for chrome100. We no longer store binary recovery data in the repository, instead we store it in the [chrome-versions package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chrome-versions) ([GitHub](https://github.com/sysce/chrome-versions)).

The packages directory contains two folders:

- Backend - API that exposes the database interfaces to HTTP
- Website - Frontend for the database/API
